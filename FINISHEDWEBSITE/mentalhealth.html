<h1>Welcome to our Mental Health section!</h1>
<h2 class = "yap">Mental health is a vital component of overall well-being, influencing how we think, feel, and act. Mental health affects our ability to handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Just like physical health, maintaining good mental health requires effort and attention. Our mental health section provides valuable resources and strategies to help you nurture your mind and achieve a balanced, fulfilling life. 
   <br> The first step is recognising you need help, which is why we have made a little quiz for you to assess yourselves, found under the **Emotional Well-being** module.
