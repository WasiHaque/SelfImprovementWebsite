        <h3 >Warming up before your workout can prevent injuries and enhance athletic performance. It also improves flexibility and reduces post-workout soreness. Start with aerobic exercises like 
        arm swings and rotations
         leg stretches
         Lunges and Squats
         walking before running.</h3>
        <h4 >2. Cool Down</h4>
        <h3>Cooling down helps your body return to its normal state. Spend a few minutes cooling down to restore normal breathing patterns and reduce muscle soreness. Light walking after aerobic exercise or stretching after resistance training are good cool-down options.</h3>
       <h4> 3. Listen to Your Body</h4>
       <h3>Be mindful of your limits, especially if you’re new to working out daily and having a routine. If you experience pain or discomfort, stop and rest before continuing. Pushing through pain can lead to injuries. Remember, progressing gradually through your fitness program helps you maintain your routine long-term and achieve the best results.</h3>
