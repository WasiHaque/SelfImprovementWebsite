      <div class="button deodorant">Deodorant</div>
      <p class="text hide1">Deodorant is essential for managing body odor and maintaining personal hygiene. Some of the best products include Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Antiperspirant & Deodorant, Degree Ultra Clear Pure Clean Antiperspirant, and Dove 0% Aluminum Deodorant12. It’s best to apply deodorant after showering when your skin is clean and dry. The benefits of using deodorant include killing odor-causing bacteria, reducing sweat, and keeping you feeling fresh throughout the day34. This can significantly boost self-wellness by enhancing your confidence and comfort in social situations. Choosing the right deodorant can also cater to specific needs, such as sensitive skin or a preference for natural ingredients. Overall, deodorant plays a crucial role in personal care routines, contributing to both physical cleanliness and emotional well-being.</p>

      <div class="button shampoo">Shampoo</div>
      <p class="text hide2">Shampoo is essential for maintaining clean, healthy hair and scalp. It removes dirt, oil, and product buildup, helping to prevent scalp issues and promote hair growth. Some of the best shampoos include R+Co Television Perfect Hair Shampoo for overall use, Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo for damaged hair, and Malin+Goetz Moisturizing Shampoo for curly hair. Using shampoo regularly, typically 2-3 times a week, balances scalp oil production and adds moisture, making hair easier to manage and style. Additionally, a good shampoo routine can enhance self-wellness by providing a sense of cleanliness and confidence. Clean, well-maintained hair can boost self-esteem and contribute to a positive self-image. Choosing the right shampoo tailored to your hair type and needs can make a significant difference in your hair’s health and your overall well-being.</p>

      <div class="button habits">Hygiene Habits</div>
      <p class="text hide3">Improving hygiene habits is essential for maintaining good health and preventing the spread of illnesses. Start by washing your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, after using the restroom, and when you come home from outside. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available. Regularly shower or bathe to keep your skin clean and free from bacteria. Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily to maintain oral hygiene. Keep your nails trimmed and clean to prevent the accumulation of dirt and germs. Change your clothes daily and wash them regularly. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces in your home, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops. Practice good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze. Lastly, maintain a healthy diet and stay hydrated to support your immune system. These habits will help you stay healthy and feel your best.</p>
